Alpha demo code for AskEdgar, based on https://github.com/mayooear/gpt4-pdf-chatbot-langchain. 
We based our code on this demo out of the many QA chatbot demos out there because of its simple codebase, which allows for quicker iteration.

Follow our blog https://askedgar.ghost.io, for details as we build towards our beta. 

Feel free to contribute. For anything that's still using a vector store as a retriever (but perhaps in more clever ways), contribute to main. 

For agents, feel free to make an experimental branch or watch this space for more.
